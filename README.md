# Sequential Performance Analysis System

A Python-based data analysis project that evaluates performance trends, consistency, and anomalies using time-series solve data.

## Features
- Parses raw solve-time logs
- Converts time formats into numerical data
- Generates rolling statistics
- Detects outliers automatically
- Visualizes performance trends

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Sequential solve-time records containing:
- solve index
- solve time
- scramble sequence

## Output Visualizations
- Trend graph
- Distribution histogram
- Rolling average plot

## How to Run

pip install -r requirements.txt  
python analysis.py

## Purpose
Demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, time-series analysis, and visualization skills.
